Algorithm:-
The loop is repeated through all possible subloops.
It converts each substring into its sequence of characters as a signature.
Updates the number of each signature in the HashMap.
It uses mathematics to count the number of anagrammatic pairs.
For each signature appearing more than once, compute the number of pairs created by the formula n(n−1)22n(n−1), where nn is the number of substrings with the same signature
